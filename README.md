The Odin Project Exercises 

Welcome to the Exercises portion of the Odin Project, this section is created to share the assignment from the course “Foundations.” 

The Project Recipes: 

This section of course allows me to practice and execute the knowledge acquired during the study of HTML basics, as well as practice the git codes learned in the previous section. 

In this project I was able to build a Boilerplate and practice the manual creation of the boilerplate in each page created for this project. 

 I used the validator from W3 suggested during this section to practice and obtain information related to my implementation of the code. I learned that is a good practice to add an attribute to the html tag to identify the language used in the document. 
 
I was able to practice inserting images, creating relative links, using different headings, create organized and unorganized lists. 

Also, I was able to practice with GitHub and git codes to create the repository and clone it into my computer.  I must say I wasn’t able to publish the repository under main but under master.  I guess I still need to learn more about it.
